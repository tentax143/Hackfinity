Build me a stunning hackathon landing page using **React + Tailwind CSS + Framer Motion + tsParticles**.  
The website should be highly animated, cyberpunk-themed, and optimized for both desktop and mobile.  

### üî• Hero Section
- Full-screen background with a **cyberpunk gradient and animated particles** (using tsParticles).  
- Hackathon name in **bold futuristic typography** at center.  
- Tagline below it with a **glowing neon accent effect**.  
- A floating **"Register on Unstop" button (CTA)** that pulses.  
- Smooth scroll-down arrow animation at the bottom.

### üé¨ Scroll Experience
- Enable **parallax scrolling effects** for background.  
- Animate each section in with **Framer Motion** (fade-up, slide-in, typewriter text).  

### üìÖ Timeline Section
- A horizontal/vertical **animated timeline**.  
- Each milestone lights up or highlights when hovered.  
- Include: "Registrations Open", "Shortlisting", "Hackathon Begins", "Demo Day", "Prize Ceremony".

### üèÜ Prizes Section (WOW Factor)
- Cards that **flip or glow on hover** showing prize details.  
- Show total prize pool (e.g. ‚Çπ1,00,000) with an **animated counter that counts up** when the section comes into view.  
- Add icons for 1st / 2nd / 3rd prize.  

### ü§ù Sponsors Section
- Showcase sponsor logos in a **carousel/slider**.  
- Each logo should glow subtly on hover.  
- If no sponsors yet, include placeholder logos.  

### üåê Community / Vibe Section
- A **glowing "Join our Discord" button**.  
- An **embedded countdown timer** (ticking down to hackathon start).  
- Background effects that shift color for hype.  

### üì± Mobile Responsiveness
- Navbar should collapse into a hamburger menu.  
- All sections should be mobile-friendly.  

### Extra Notes
- Use **Tailwind** for styling.  
- Use **Framer Motion** for all animations.  
- Use **tsParticles** for background particles.  
- Keep the vibe **cyberpunk / neon (purple, pink, teal, blue)**.  
- Deploy-ready React project structure.  

Finally, make sure to keep a **sticky navbar** with links: Home | About | Timeline | Prizes | Sponsors | Community | Register.
